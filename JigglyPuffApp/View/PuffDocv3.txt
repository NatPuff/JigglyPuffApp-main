{Mario}*

Puff can rest out of low % Mario combos like upthrow/dthrow stuff, be careful since if they read it then they can cape then fsmash and do hella damage 

Sdi di down away on mario up air combos, in neutral mario will up air and bair, nair is a combo breaker

Mario up b loses to aerials but nair is the best 

You can pound 2 frame mario up b but its hard

At around 30ish i think is when mario’s will fish for up air and it stops at about 70/80 but its an amazing move vs puff

You have to respect mario mashing a lot of the time since his aerials are very safe, you can parry and grab/rest but that's really it 

cape doesn’t wake up puff, so missing a rest is scary 




{DK}*

Dair loops are cool you should use them at about 15ish, at 0 it can work if they don't know about up b combo breaker or just that it doesn't work

U can soft fair the up b and it true combos into itself, stay grounded and watch for the 50/50 mixup of aerial/hold forward or grab



Tech the down b :D

Mash out of grab stuff and watch where you do unsafe aerials and see if ur close to a plat when you do it, that way u know how much time u have to mash out of a grab since his ding dong thingie works on plats

You can rest dash attack

{Link}*

Nair beats boomerang

His mobility isn't great so fthrow is good in this mu, cover jump first usually and drift back with nair when u hit him at low % since it isn't safe on hit and link can buffer up b usually

If he's using bomb try and intercept orr if ur close and you read his bomb then attack him, 

Don't cross up his shield just make him scared since link can up b oos, you can do this by dashing and taking stage/ jumping, a good analogy is the peach’s perspective in peach icies for melee

Don't neutral get up really since link fair is crazy and just good in general

Bomb has more hitstun based on percent so puff can bomb nair at higher% and combo into other things if link is at high %

{Samus}*

U can beat samus aerials with ur own and control pace 

Samus down b has lag on it so you can just wait and hit the down b by reacting

U can beat small charge shots and missiles with nair

Don't get mad at up b oos

Nair beats up b

Wait for samus dair if theyre in disadvantage

Samus bair is stronger then you think 

Samus upthrow is a kill throw 

Samus cant escape combos 



{Yoshi}*

Keep center

Nair can beat heavy armor but its rly hard plus it cant rly be staled

don't overextend just get a pound nair and reset neutral

Yoshi egg  (up b) has alot of end lag so u can go out and fair/nair since they cant use double jump armor in that position

Dash attack pound on ledge and dtilt on ledge can kill the recovery but the yoshi has counterplay

Rest combos are much tighter due to double jump armor so u cant be laid back on rest combo %

Go for down throw over fthrow at higher %, even if more rage and not offstage every % counts 

Crossing up is pointless but if you want to then only use dair or maybe nair if you nair on the front

{Kirby}*
Two ways to play it!!!


Optimal- timeout style and staying on plats to force having stage control

Interactive- stay grounded and focus on dair combos

Nair beats kirby up b

Drill rest is good in this mu
Kirby up b is good in neutral but u can just shield and whiff punish with grab/nair dependent on spacing

When u find a punish use fair nair alot, force kirby to waste his jumps by putting him in coin flip situations (50/50’s on him dying)

{Fox}*
Dair is really really good in this matchup, with ppl with not perfect SDI u can dair dair dair drill rest for at least 90% if u have no rage but with perfect u still get 40/50

Soft fair is better then strong fair in this mu since it true combos into nair/ another fair depending on % if fox is offstage 

Expect fox to mix up but spam full hop/short hop alot and plat camp since theres no real way to get in for him so he’ll do those options with a nair or a dair

Fox nair and dash attack arent safe on hit at 0-5??% ik its 0 but unsure how much it goes too 

To gimp side b if you know theyre too far away focus on what direction theyll choose to go after the side b, u can gimp fox up b with soft fair and trade or any aerial really if you dont get flamed by the recovery, di nair up smash away, and dair upsmash as well

If fox jumps to get back on he might faIr so see what options he likes to do when hes trying to get back to stage 

Upsmash has so much end lag you can basically do anything to it, i think you can just run up and rest or even sing 


{Pika}*
Nair/dash attack beat tjolt
Sdi up on lighting loops which is nair dragdown stuff, (you can rest it if they mess up)

Dash attack has trample properties so itll beat moves so if you read pika going for a tilt or 
another move u can beat it out with dash attack
Dthrow over fthrow in this mu since u cant edgeguard pika

Pound 2 frames pika up b and Dsmash can also 2 frame

Fsmash covers all options on ledge so dont try and think you can get past it
Bair and just mashing in general is good in this mu since pika doesnt have the tools to beat it, on pika fair if ur at kill % sdi super in since electric moves can be SDI’d more

At high % watch for pika upthrow and just take damage over shielding, or spotdodge rest if u rly wanted

On bair strings sdi away from pika stuff, you still take damage but not as much 

Once u hit 130ish or just high % in general, up air starts to kill if your in the air so dont think your safe because vs pika theres always a chance of you dying to something you dont feel like you should die too


{Luigi}*  


Combos into fthrow are cool, please do them (best one is nair grab)

Mash sh rising pound at 0 so you dont get hit by 0 to death or the up b 

If you get grabbed the optimal perfect SDI is up and in/ just in in general, mixing it up is still good since it throws luigi off pretty bad but still reactable for luigi

Get hit by fireball at low %

Luigi upsmash oos is scary so be careful

If luigi is in disadvantage just shield and wait for nair/down b at times

Nair beats luigi up b so just go down and be confident (as well as green missile)

If luigi has a jump but he's really far offstage hes almost forced to jump and side b so just read the jump immediately, if he doesnt then u go down and ff nair

Punish down b with fthrow or dash attack, rest is rly hard and you usualy need to be in the air to punish and even then its crazy hard



*{Ness} 
Similar to luigi where you want fthrows
Hold shield alot at low % since theyll be mashing aerials ALOT

If you read a magnet just nair it, at worst you only take a little bit of % 

If ur in the air getting hit my pk thunder then try and nair/dair it or get to ledge, nair is better to use then dair

Using soft fair or nair to catch double jumps is huge and then you know how to edgeguard ness already

Watch for up air its really hard to deal with and you have to respect the move

Trading with ness offstage is greatm you can wait for ness to try and hit you away and punish them for trying to reversal you offstage.

*{Captain Falcon}

Treat falcon side b kinda like incin’s due to its super armor properties, you can still punish kinda based on where you are but usually if ur far away just let it happen and punish, there are situations where sing beats it but that's only if they suck

Falcon when hes dashing at you if trying to bait you to shield so he can use his advantage and abuse the slow airdodge puff has so always have in the back in ur mind that a grab could happen, his dash isnt great so in mid range is when he’ll normally go for grabs

If you aerial when falcon is up b ing there's a chance he grabs you but the nair comes out first
https://youtu.be/i3ipskpDWeE 1:22

Fthrow of course is good in this matchup, watch for jump over going low since you can cover both options by starting at going high, if you have a hard read then ofc go down, 

Upsmash is really annoying so when he does it just whiff punish don't try and beat it out or anything 

If falcon kick is far away you can hold shield and sing it

Ledgetrapping i literally just nair on ledge falcon doesn't have much 

Dont jump into falcon instead just play a grounded pace until u get a hit and then go crazy in the air since falcon has alot of set anti air tools

Lastly in neutral falcon loves bair since it can be safe and on ledge, falcon’s nair doesnt really have any risk vs puff unless theres a hard read and even then 


*{Puff}
Stay centered and at low % be careful for them resting you out of your own combo

Dair can combo into rest super easily since her airdodge is frame 4

U can parry pound and rest and sometimes u dont need a parry if they're close

Spam back air and uptilt at high % since puff doesn't have reliable ways to deal with it

Puff has a frame 4 airdodge
{Peach}*
WAR OF ATTRITION 

Nair beats peach up b if your close enough and just peach’s tool kit at times it forces to peach to run away a lot more than she should

If peach is holding shield u honestly need to respect it or take a gamble, hitting peach’s shield is honestly a gamble, i like pound the most if its spaced right but any aerial hitting peach’s shield is scary cause fc nair 

Watch for peach’s resources, its good to remember float because itll change how they recover and you can use that to advantage

If peach has a turnip you can nair through small ones but it's better to just shield/ weave around I mean you have 5 jumps 

Peach’s up air is broken if your in disadvantage so her anti air is up air and just up air to be honest other then just throwing the turnip up 

On the ledge just pray and mix it up there isnt really a winning or a neutral answer to it 

Peach is usually gonna be sitting in shield so you can get more grabs then you might expect, still watch out cause peach can just float but it can get in the peach’s head 

Play more footsies over just spamming aerials everywhere 











*{Bowser}*
Puff can sing oos dair and up b

Nair can beat up b but hitting him when he starts is inconsistent 

Dair loops are great on bowser and any dair loop will work 

Dont contest upsmash it isn't worth it, wait for end lag and punish with dair

Dsmash 2 frame is weirdly good on bowser

Bowser’ anti airs are uptilt and up air 

Upsmash is invincible so dont try and mess with it
(twitter link is diing bowser side b)
https://twitter.com/TGStatic/status/1223734155235606528?s=20
{Icies}*
If you fthrow icies on the ledge the AI will immediately jump plus since they dont DI u can kill the AI almost every time

You can go offstage vs the up b and get hit and they might die or just go off and nair the player climber

If u get hit by uptilt stuff sdi di up to make it way harder

U can nair the sopo side b for free

Stay diagonally in the air from icies

Icies can upsmash oos pound

Icies will likely blizzard wall in neutral in which you have to hold it and weave around to scare IC’s 
*{Sheik}

Dont try and punish any move sheik does it isnt really worth it, instead try and trade with aerials since puff’s will beat sheik’s most of the time 

dair/drill rest works pretty well on sheik so it can be reliable, try and keep center stage to make sheik not able to control the pace of the match, her speed can mean puff cant play the game but thats if ur letting her get her strengths by getting center 

Sheik’s kill game is reliant on raindrops (falling up air upsmash on plats) and needle upsmash when the sheik is at a higher level, 

Rest combo breaker is cool at low %, i’ve had success with DI away on Fthrow bouncing fish but also on DI in for other setups

Bair is also an underrated kill move especially on the ledge

If shes facing away then shes gonna do bair, tomahawk grab or needle kill confirm

If shes facing toward then itll be nair fair grab or needle setup

*{Zelda}
This should always realistically go to time, treat comboing like yoshi and just reset neutral

Zelda does not have a reliable option to deal with spaced bair so spam it alot 

Wait for neutral b’s to come out and punish in ANY SITUATION (basically 90% of the matchup)



Vs phantom knight either mix it up and attack or just jump away and try and take stage control, pound can sometimes win if you catch them not using it in time but its up to zelda to decide how you play advantage 

If ur offstage don't immediately attack zelda wait for her to commit cause she will either go on the stage and there's lag or go to ledge in disadvantage 

Zelda has a tough time trying to catch puff but her anti air’s like up air are crazy, its up to the zelda to keep composure
{Doc}*
FTHROWWW

Nair beats down b and up b
Dont hit doc’s shield
Dair loops are harder so hold shield after combos if they like to up b 
Platform camp if you need too

Nair beats pills, dont DI in on down throw 
Pichu*
Dthrow over Fthrow, any % is important in this matchup 
Mash dair since pichu does not rly have huge punishes unless its badly spaced
Drill rest is amazing in this mu and dair dair drill rest is crazy as well
Pound 2 framing the up b works wonders and smash
Quick attack doesn't have a hitbox so you can just hit it over and over again 
Pichu’s kill throw is fthrow 
DI the upthrow PLEASE, if you dont DI it you die, literaly any direction
Sdi di the lighting loops up which is up air bair strings for pichu

{Falco}*

Soft fairs can be big for edgeguarding at mid percent and if they dont have a jump then soft fairs kill

At low % you can rest out of falco combos

This matchup does not have a neutral so itll just be awkward movement, 

Falco fair is -10 so you can grab it but watch out on shielding since falco can upthrow then do 40% +

Falco oos can upsmash 
Puff can dsmash 2 frame and kill falco at 30 if he has no jump and if he does hes almost forced to side b 

You can soft fair falco recovery or nair it and trade and kill him like that, even dair works.

Ur goal isnt to necessarily kill off an edgeguard but to force falco to use his jump, even setups like nair jab are good cause it gets him offstage plus damage 

Uptilt bair and uptilt up air are the 2 big kill setups from uptilt, if a grab happens then upthrow up air exists

Falco at low % can down throw forward air, your best bet is to sdi away from fair and you might escape but it prob wont do enough. 
*{Marth}
Stay center stage the entire game, do not leave it for any reason 
At low % see if the martth likes to up b and only go for true combos to punish if u read the first lucina up b

Stay closer to marth if ur trying to hit him over spacing it so u dont get hit by anything huge

Watch out for marth side b since the tipper will kill at 50 potentially or lower

You can make more errors in this mu over lucina but u can still die hella early at times, alot of marths will mash tipper ftilt on ledge or ftilt in general

*{Lucina}
Stay center stage the entire game, do not leave it for any reason or u lose
At low % see if the lucina likes to up b and only go for true combos to punish if u read the first lucina up b

Lucina bair is rly rly strong that will be the usual kill move as well as up air

Nair trades with lucina up b 

PARRY EVERYTHING, its how u get ur grabs and dairs if lucina spaces 

At high % watch for uptilt and bair, think if ur at 110-120 that anything kills


FTHROWW is cool but you’re combos will be taken down by up b so only go for true follow ups unless theres a hard read

{Young Link}*
The big thing to know is ur nair beats every projectile except bomb and fully charged arrow

Try and bait the young link player to do an up b oos to rest/ whiff punish but know the timing you can't really blindly do it

When offstage trying to edgeguard stay right outside of his up b range so you can punish if he does it early to hit you, you can react to him airdodging or nairing to fastfall with this as well

Upsmash and uptilt are really good anti airs and can shield poke puff pretty well so angle ur shield or get out of the situtation

Nair beats the up b but young link can drift to make it harder to catch 

Hold forward when you get a combo because young link has no get off me’s in this matchup

Dont try and grab down tilt

Theres 2 hitboxes of boomerang, one where is when it first comes out of young link and the other when its far away, the first one i said can covert into anything so be careful 

His tether is like any other 
{Ganondorf}*
FTHROW
Any dair combo has to be converted into a Fthrow kill since % doesnt matter in this matchup when it comes to killing
Dont hit ganon’s shield but if u do immediately nair afterwards/ dont cross his shield up since he will upsmash and youll take hella damage

Weave around his hitboxes and go for grabs or dairs into grab

The entire matchup is based on the grab

Nair trades with ganon up air and nair

If u tech check and he has a jump then wait for airdodge or keep ledge trapping and if he doesnt have a jump then wait for airdodge/aerial 

Nair has more knockback then fair so for finishers for edgeguarding go for nair

Dont hit ganon’s shield without immediately drifting away 

Pound nair setups are perfect on ganon 
*{Mewtwo}
Any dair combo will work including drill rest 

Go for rising pound over normal pound so u dont get grabbed

Grabs don't matter as much u just want m2 on the ledge

Pound and Dsmash 2 frame well

Try and space bair more over nair/fair incase you get disabled with the exception of pound

Go for down throw over throw for damage unless u want stage control badly or just need him off completely over wanting him on top of you

Watch for jab at ledge or jab in general, its his best way of getting damage
{Roy}*
This matchup is the definition of using there own moves against them, puff can never actually play aggressive in this matchup or go in at top level due to how fast roy and his buttons are

So your goal is to play more neutral ground based over aerials, sh dair is rly good in this matchup and pound 

Play neutral/footsies with roy and find an opening asap, puff’s airspeed will let you

Puff nair or any of her moves will beat out roy up b if you hit his face but not the sword 

Once you hit jair percent (jab bair) you have to go with more defensive options or else you lose, still play neutral but be wary about what roy has vs you, EX: on ledge try and mixup escaping by any means.

Any combo works on roy 

Oos roy can up b and if not drifted basically any of his moves

Pound is still risky even if its good 
*{Chrom}
You can sing oos chrom up b, focus on confirms into throw 

Chrom up b does ALOT of damage its his best oos option so be careful
Chrom’s will airdodge to ledge over trying to up b recover so wait for airdodge

If hes just dashing around and not committing, find a way to get to center stage 

His jab can be punished by nair and dair but dair only works if parried plus for both aerials you have to be perfect 

You can float out of the up b if the chrom holds fowardf and you DI in at times (unsure how consistent)

If you get a jab lock sing at a % where rest wont kill you can go for a down smash or fthrow instead, the down smash base knockback is crazy and can setup edgeguards, even if you can go for a up air rest, if ur not comfy down smash is a good second option 

Watch out for jab fsmash if you get hit by a close jab by him, EX: chrom jabbing on ledge 

You can dair the up b at the axis or any aerial or try and hit before the up b comes out 
*{GnW}-
Gnw has no neutral like at all, his gameplan is to tilt and annoy you 

His dair can be punished with any of puff’s moves basically if you hold shield except sing bair and up air since his dair is -17

If you mess up on his shield just take the up b oos and reset neutral

Pound can clank with upsmash and is just weirdly good vs gnw 

You dont need to commit vs gnw and the way hes facing usually will tell what hes doing

EX: if hes facing forward and in the air he can only really fair or dair as a huge mixup
If hes on the ground facing forward gnw will nair

If hes facing away expect bair 

The way game and watch plays is naturally robotic so anything you think will happen will happen theres not really a mixup to his game 

Be careful about being on the ledge since ftilt can beat out any ledge mixup if ur neutral getuping and dsmash is crazy also

Alot of rest combos work wonders on gnw and defensive play forces the gnw player to show there habits and gimmick playstyle 

Sdi up on gnw nair if you get nair’d 

Gnw up air is really really good ur best bet is to just mixup landings
*{MK}- 

The entire mu is based on living from 0-10, at this % u dont wanna get dash attacked at all so play very very safe at all times, if u do somehow get hit try and DI/SDI up and into MK to make the up air harder, u can mix it up but thats the optimal one

On down throw its the exact same DI pattern but out can still work

Drill rest is crazy on MK and combos in general, up b oos is scary but its risky for MK to use since if it doesnt work or they miss, still good tho out of shield, 

MK’s down b if he attacks has alot of lag to where you can sing/ at times rest and just anything its -81

{Pit/Dpit (will be saying pit)}*
Pit’s neutral is based on doing nair dash attack and grab, those are the biggest things if pit is facing foward, when hes facing backward the pit player will most likely back air since its a hella safe option

If pit grabs at low % he can down throw dair nair or just down throw up smash or just down throw anything, sdi pit nairup and away 

At high % if you DI in pit has a down throw up air that kills pretty early id say at about 110 but unsure on % 

On edgeguarding wait for the pit to side b since its kind of a forced option for pit to do, you can do this by shielding on the ledge or going out before the side b has an active hitbox, if the pit is stalling you can just stall too since you do have 5 jumps, its better to just nair and just keep them off over going for a combo if they're offstage and they are stalling.

Pit side b can be rested so that's cool

pit's out of shield options are upsmash and fsmash vs puff since if pit parries and reads the drift then pit can fsmash. Also pit forward throw is a kill move

Lastly, arrows lose to puff aerials pretty consistently so you can just hit them and if pit uses them offstage you can just go out and beat him up for it 
*{ZSS}-

Before playing this matchup accept that you have no control over the pace, at most you can crouch and its harder to hit but even then its very annoying to attempt to play a neutral so instead focus on keeping center and making zss lose less of her options in disadvantage

If zss loses her jump immediately assume she’ll use her down b to recover with a jump nair and then immediately cover down with ff nair to read the jump 

Puff nair beats zss up b and her laser gun 

You can crouch under zss upsmash from the back

If zss side b’s and ur at the end of the tail don't try and punish but if ur close then nair 

Zss likes to ledge trap with Dsmash if she reads neutral get up (dont neutral get up vs zss :D)
Bair and side b are rly good vs puff on the ledge since she has 0 option to deal with it unless the puff player decides to put themselves in a risky situation.

{Wario}*
5:05-5:10 is when full waft comes out

Puff nair beats wario up b 

If wario is trying to only hit nair 2 its a free parry rest or parry anything

Try and control the pace because wario has to weave around you due to the airspeed 

Waft combos that are perfect on puff are nair waft and up air waft, since puff has a frame 4 airdodge, setups work better on her so be careful since anything will basically work

On the ledge watch for ftilt since it 2 frames, bite is also scary and beats alot of option plus it kills and heals wario 

Try and keep bike on the stage so wario’s recovery becomes much more limited

If puff throws wario and wario di’s up wario can just jump bike

Di wario nair away for combos, if you know theyre reading it you can try di in to try and go the other way but di away is ur best friend 

Watch for wario bair, also wario dair can cover alot if puff loses or only has 1 or 2 jumps left.

If wario is standing up with bike it kills WAYYYY EARLIER.
*{Snake}- 
If snake is on a platform you just have to hold that and get center stage, you can read options with pound or an aerial but its very hard, ur able to react to fastfall airdodge but thats really it 

If snake is holding grenade a mixup you can do is just go up and grab and theyll take both grenade and throw damage and potential combos

At high % you can upthrow then throw the grenade at them if you know the timing

It's more about feints over hold forward and mashing to bait uptilts out and punish with dash attack or moves that can put them into tumble 

Strong nair, bair, and strong fair are all methods to beat up cypher, depending on percent you can do wonders

If your far offstage with snake and he has no resources chances are he’ll C4 recover so try and be aggressive and hit with any aerial if ur close enough, if not get to stage as soon as possible 


{Ike}*
FTHROW 

DONT JUMP, just like palu its never worth ur goal is to try and force the ike to play ur game 

Up b can be singed oos

Dont just hold forward cause ike can ftilt or uptilt any sorta unorthodox option ur forced to play footsies 

If you fthrow or get a grab focus on covering the jump first 

Airdodge beats ike side b 

Dealing with ike recovering, you can dair the apex and dair loop or pound it, if timed right ike auto dies on certain stages like PS2, but dair can also mess them up, i prefer dair or nair the most, you can also trade with ike up b by getting hit  

If ike is on the ledge trying to get and you mess up just be right away from ike up b hitbox since alot of ike’s will just up b and go back to ledge 

If you get hit in the air by ike you have to pray to go back down, pound stall fastfall aerial do anything possible, even going to ledge can work 

Ike’s dash attack exists dont forget about it 




PT*
{Squirtle}
Squirtle can up b oos most things u can do but if he reads wrong go for a Fthrow or pound nair grab if possible or just a pound setup, other then that PT players dont rly go squirtle but backthrow will be his gameplan if hes staying squirtle if ur at high %

{Ivysaur}: Nair beats razor leaf
Watch for grab alot since ivy mains will fish for it
If ur in the air remember the only thing ivy will go for that does real damage is up air so base ur disadvantage and not getting hit by that 
On ledge ivy mains will fsmash so u can just jump away, if u see them mashing razor leaf just nair it or mix up how to get off ledge
Gimping ivy is just like any other tether, if ivy doesnt have a jump then theres a forced swap to zard in which u go to the pokeball and kill zard before he can do anything

{Charizard}:

Space bair the matchup, only do spaced moves into his shield he can upsmash anything that isnt spaced

Try to condition shield to grab and if hes at low % he has a combo breaker that you need to wait for 

Vs flare blitz if hes going to ledge u just have to respect but if he messes up u can hold shield and punish end lag if he doesnt get to the ledge and goes a lil bit above, if he goes high just try and intercept with an aerial, u can rest ior sing if u truly know but using an aerial is better

On ledge just pray, most characters have to make a read, puff can jump away but thats still hella scary even with puff’s airdodge mixups/pound


{Diddy}*
The first thing you wanna do in this matchup is see if the diddy likes monkey flip/has a habit

Doing checks to the diddy is important since it can reveal alot about the player

checks= keeping banana away and learning when they monkey flip 

Vs diddy accept youll lose more neutral interactions but also know ur punishes will do more damage then diddy will do to you usually

Any soft hitting or basic aerial will basically kill diddy is hes up b’ing, if you nair while hes upbing at middish percent you should be able to go for a fair afterwards 

Diddy oos option is upsmash and its fast but cant beat all of your drift + if you bait it out you can punish/scare the diddy harder since any error as diddy can be punished hard 


{Lucas}*
Vs lucas you’re always gonna assume hes trying to use a tether if hes not high enough to go high, this way you can still edgeguard even if he isnt using it

Lucas cant really play neutral since puff’s buttons just beat out lucas’s at times, you still have to be careful since if the lucas is reading a hold forward then the lucas invincible upsmash might happen

If you get a pound then lucas should always be combo’d offstage since he doesn't really have any get off me tools so hold forward when you get a hit

If the lucas is on ledge theres a super high the lucas will go for a grab or do a hold forward aerial, its good if youre far enough away to just hold shield if lucas is on the ledge or if you hard read lucas to just do a nair 

If lucas immediately recovers on being edgeguarded then you can just wait and punish the end lag, if the lucas stalls then you can go down and edgeguard

If you’re on the ledge watch out for fair and ftilt, ftilt can 2 frame very well and fair covers almost every option, i like getup attack vs lucas but ofc mix it up 
{Sonic}
My experience in this matchup is friendlies with ken and wifi sonics 

Id honestly recommended banning over going to PS2 at top level at least, sonic on PS2 is crazy 

Sing and rollout beat spindash

Sonic can up b out of dair loops if good sdi 
Hold shield ALOT vs sonic to me at least just because 
{D3}*
Pound 2 frame on ledge is amazing and u can convert almost anything on it at lower %’s with idj aerials or even no idj (counterplay is they hold down but if u read it u can dair loop it 

Nair destroys the gordo

DAIR LOOPS

If theyre offstage try and force them to use jumps, u can combo with any move like pound to catch d3 offstage or just aerials in general, if d3 uses gordo offstage and ur close u can punish if ur timing is good but its risky 


{Olimar}*
Up air and nair take out pikmin usually

Mashing vs olimar is really helpful if ur not sure what to do just put out an aerial

Whistle armor is really annoying but you can read it with a sing

If youre dealing with two purples find anyway to kill them whether with dash attack or just anything to kill the purples, sacrifice % even 

Nair can beat purples but olimar can just upsmash or do anything afterwards so still drift afterwards dont hold forward

Olimar players love trying to reversal you when theyre offstage so wait for then to do it and punish   

Pound is good in this matchup just because you can drift out of olimar’s range afterwards 

Dair into drill rest or just dair combos still work great on olimar, i like drill rest setups in this mu since olimar can whistle out of alot of situations.

Lastly this will be a long game/set so take a deep breathe and play.

Yellow has the most range of pikimin, red is normal, blue is upthrow kill, white does most damage, and purple does knockback.

{Alph}- 

Not real < 3
{Lucario}*
Lucario’s fsmashed can be spammed really well vs puff due to its reach and just its hard to punish, best option is usually nair if youre close

Lucario is combo food and light so anything will work on lucario, but make sure your execution is good since lucario can just kill you at - percents if lucario has rage/a lot of aura 

On edgeguarding i like to soft fair lucario since itll set up into a nair and kill really early, fair is better then nair at edgeguarding in this mu

Aura sphere loses to nair until its charged up by alot

If you drift really bad then lucario can upsmash oos and if lucario reads your drift and parries then a potential fsmash 

If lucario grabs you at low percent youl lprob be taking a upthrow fair or down throw fair setup so you just have to hold the percent, if the lucario is facing away its either gonna be a bair or a tomahawk side b which is the command grab so be wary, a well time spotdodged can beat both of these options or you can just jump away 

Lucario;s up air is an underrated anti air and it kills so watch for that more than you expect 
{Rob}*

The easiest z drop gyro combo is z drop gyro nair 

General gameplan is reading when rob will either nair or do a projectile

Pound is pretty good in this matchup if its spaced in comparison to others due to the risk reward being pretty cool 

Dair loops are great ofc so focus on dair in neutral even if pound is semi usable, 

Rob upsmash cant handle the drift of puff aerials if they're already spaced, if they aren't then rob has a free upsmash, rob can also upsmash dash attack very easily 

If rob is offstage focus on scaring over attacking until you fully read an option 

I like to use pound to cover rob as a mixup but fair and nair are the go to’s 

Soft fair can be good to true combo into nair if theyre offstage trying to recover

You can rest rob while in dthrow if theyre close to you

Lastly on ledge watch for bair due to the lingering hitboxes, if u see rob with gyro there will most likely be z drop gyro shenanigans so notice the situation immediately and either jump away roll or getup attack 

{Toon Link}*

Toon link’s design is very basic, the gameplan is similar to the other link’s with the exception of looking out for certain kill setups

Toon link will want upsmash oos, up b oos and bomb fair when it comes to kill options, uptilt into up air isnt always true but it can cover airdodges and can read jumps at times so it just will work but never kill due to the sour hit

All of toon link’s projectile’s other then bomb get beat out by nair

Toon link’s up b has amazing drift so he will always make it back/assume he always will, i like waiting right on top and hitting with a soft nair so he cant sweet spot the ledge

{Wolf}
Percents do not matter when u are against wolf, always watch for a setup by wolf to do either crazy damage or kill you


{Villager}*
Nair beats lloyd rocket pretty easily if its active, if villager is holding it then it can explode on ur face, if hes riding it you can hit villager but not the rocket 

Nair beats slingshot as well 

A Lot of villagers will try and recover far away to mix up just going vertically from ledge 

3 pounds will take tree down i believe

Stay grounded and only jump with a hitbox out usually like nair or dair 

If villager has his tree out just play patient and watch for axe and bait him to cut the tree down
{Mega man}*

Bair can beat the leaf shield,

If megaman is offstage and you know hes using his side b, you can intercept and attack or wait for him to come to you 

Megaman has no get off me tools

His oos is upsmash and can be uptilt

Uptilt can be sang or even rested if they miss 

If you see megaman camping with up b by just bouncing then you just have to wait till theres an opening with any means possible, you can intercept and read but if you jump with him you might get up air’d 

Do not try and punish megaman dair if hes doing it close to the stage, its bait and it’s 0 or plus 1 on shield 

If megaman is offstage he has to recover vertical so he can just come to you so don't stress about knowing where he’ll be, you can always be above and have an aerial out and since and repeat

Megaman’s big kill moves naturally are fair bair and upsmash, fsmash is also good

If you get hit by megaman up air just take it or airdodge and see if you get blown up, if you do airdodge airdodge down and out of the up air hitbox so you maybe escape or go a little bit down, i prefer to do nothing and take the hit, but unsure on the best optimal thing to do 

{Wii fit}*
DSmash 2 frame is very good vs wii fit recovery 

All her moves usually hit both ways so crossing up is pointless

If you're trying to edgeguard wait for the header and immediately approach, if you think she’ll dair and ur not close then fall with her and nair the lag of wii fit’s dair

If wii fit is in the air try and be horizontal since ur able to control wherever wii fit is forced to be in but try and always fastfall in that situation 
{Rosa}*
Moves that destroy luma
Pound dash attack and nair once luma has been hit once/twice depending on what has been hit by

Very slow matchup if the rosa wants it to be, she can control the pace with luma but cant without it, her best moves vs puff in neutral are spaced bair and even star bit can be good since it can throw off neutral

Oos rosa has upsmash with luma but without you wont really die to anything unless ur at high % so when i play vs rosa i try to mash a little bit more but it can be punished so just dont go in a blind rage 

If you see luma anywhere try and kill it and sacrifice %, 10-20% of damage is better then getting oppressed 

Vs the rosa up b you can do the basic nair edgeguard under the stage, rosa is a little bit light so its easier to kill rosa then youd expect offstage

End combos with nair EX: fair fair nair especially with rage, if you can just do a fair chain then do it 

On ledge rosa will try and bait you with an fsmash or just bair alot/ catch an aerial from ledge with upsmash 
{Little Mac}*
Fthrow the game

Any punish u can get should be a throw if you can get them off ledge

At low % mac up b is a combo breaker (mainly with dair loops)

If mac does the dair recover trick u can just go off and aerial 

If you call out mac’s side b you can beat it before he uses it, also punishable at the top 

Wait for counter if they dont have a jump/side b

Puff nair beats mac up b 
{Greninja}*
Dont get dash attacked, getting dash attacked can mean a potential infinite at top level play (dash attack up air uptilt up air uptilt fsmash) if you get dash attacked in a bad place, dash attack can be punished by grab or dair being the 2 best options, nair or anything works even rest, rest is scary to use due to how greninja moves with dash attack, if you know the timing go for it.

Nair beats small shurkien but not big ones 

If you have a move out it can beat shadow sneak but its risky cause it can trade if theres error 

You can also wait for shadow sneak end lag to run out 

Puff out frame datas greninja if hes facing forward so puff can actually control where greninja can go once you learn the mu, nair and fair can just beat out what greninja does 

Up air at high % sometimes just doesnt work vs puff like you just fall out, idk the % or how reliable this even is 

If greninja is drift back short hop fairing at a last hit situation you can either gamble and nair or just dash around so you dont give him an opening

Vs his up b it goes at set angels similar to quick attack so you can usually assume greninja wont be going to ledge and instead not even trying to deal with an edgeguard situation, greninja’s are really good at saving there jump since if they dont puff has guaranteed kill setups for edgeguards, watch for the jump or just give him % and reset neutral. 

Watch for dtilt up b, at full rage it can kill at 60 or even lower and even no rage it kills pretty early 




{Mii Brawler}*
The moveset is the flipkick,shot put, thrupper and onslaught, i have the most experience against these so yea, if this isnt the best lmk and i can do more research 

Mii brawler should be treated like a fox typed character, as in the name hes a brawler character that wants to get in, but he can also be played very defenseily due to his speed, his best kill moves that just kill normally are upsmash and bair, hitting brawler shield is scary cause if theres a parry ur dead, expect a ton of footsies due to mii brawler speed theres not gonna be any commitment from both side when playing.

If mii brawler is facing away expect a back air 

Puff is the only charfacter i believe that just gets beat up by thrupper, down throw up b should always work on puff, ur best bet is to mix up DI but brawler can read that so once you get about 70-80 no rage expect them to use that and with rage itll kill hella early 

If mii brawler uses the feint kick just hold shield and see where they go since theres so much end lag on it, hitting the start up also works 
{Mii Sword}*
Moveset is tornado, chakram, skyward slash dash (this move sounds so corny but i also play puff so cant judge) ,reversal slash most amount of experience with this moveset 


This is a time out game, mii sword basic kill options are up air and bair, watch for these 2 moves the most on killing since mii sword has a trouble time killing so theyll be fishing for these 2 moves ALOT 

All of mii sword’s zoning options are highly committal, nair is amazing in this mu since mii sword doesnt have the best range in the world for dealing with it, DI away from down throw up air (think this is right?)

Mii sword’s recovery cant be 2 framed but its -38, so if you shield if they up b on stage its a free sing or rest depending on how confident you are, if mii sword di’s away its most likely because theyll use there up b so watch for that and get to stage first and ledge tra/punish the onstage come up

Watch for tornado on ledge, you can just wait it out or go over it its def a gimmick but if you get hit then tornado up air exist 


{Mii Gunner}*
Moveset is charge blast, stealth blast/missle (will talk on both), arm rocket, bomb drop, most amount of experience with this moveset 

If mii gunner is offstage, NAIR RIGHT BY THE LEDGE LIKE BELOW IT, very important 

Nair beats the missile but not the strong one

Mii gunner’s oos option is upsmash

Mii gunner’s mine can be beaten up up air pound or basically anything, unsure on the data, need more testing but that move isnt super great vs puff 

Charge shot is a damage dealer move over a kill move it does hella damage, fair charge shot and nair charge shot can work well 

Mii gunner up air goes through the stage and is a great anti air

Mii gunner bair is gonna against puff because if spaced she doesnt really have an option against that

Mii gunner will usually make it back so dont sleep on the recovery, if you do sleep ur making the game last way longer WAYYY LONGER

On the ledge you can stall or if they have a mine then hit it away 
{Palu}*
DONT JUMP EVER, not worth it always try and take center stage 

If palu is shielding by the ledge the palu player will try and grab you

Sdi nair fully up because itll stop any huge % from being taken place 

If palu is facing away expect bair and tomahawk forward, if shes facing toward except grab fair or nair, nair at low % and fair as a mixup 

You can dair right under the ledge and kill palu hella early 

Platform camping can be weirdly good or just circle camping palu so if ur not sure what to do then stalling is weirdly good in this mu

Palu up b has alot of start up so if ur by palu the nair will usually hit 
{Pac Man}*
Every puff thinks its unwinnable except me :D 

Pacman hydrant only loses to strong hit of back air if it isn't staled, if hydrant is on ledge you can hit it and fade back or force pac to come out, its a game of chicken  
You can destroy pellets by just going out when pac is side b ing, when u hit pac in this state pac cant use his side b again, but if you hit him he gets it back, so the gameplan is to jus

Pac loses his up b when you bounce on it after he bounces twice, (yellow) 

If pac is using his neutral b with no jump he's forced to airdodge or use the fruit and if he has a jump he's def gonna jump, if he doesnt you just follow 

When he throws orange apple melon u can just hold shield and catch it (easiest fruit)

If he throws bell u have to be in a set spot in the air to catch or hold shield and catch with a strict timing

If pacman is in shield he will most likely use nair, just accept u took 8 and reset and not a big deal

You can do moves through the hydrant with practice EX: nair
If ur in the air matching horizontally with pac and he does hydrant u can go and pound or aerial in general, if pac is above u just wanna fastfall and reset neutral/ whiff punish potential aerials 

If pac is on ledge be careful on holding forward since his grab is super active and can kill 

Lastly pac’s fsmash is a freak of nature and is active for a while so u have to be thinking of fsmash when ur going in and seeing if theyll mash it, playing in the air similar to how you would against icies can be very helpful.

{Robin}*
Nair beats arcfire really badly, if you are grounded and just focus on crouching this matchup can be much easier, 

Robin’s recovery eventually runs out so the basic edgeguard will just be to always nair and look at how much more resources robin has to recover 

If robin has levin sword try and bait it out over trying to attack robin when they have the sword 

Crouching beats all of neutral b 

If you get hit by arcfire try and sdi out immediately 

Robin has checkmate but its a small % but if you see robin going for grabs at 80ish they might be trying for that 

Robin kill throw is backthrow
{Shulk}*
Upthrow on smash art can kill at 80-90 based on stage (i’ve killed at 76 with rage on smashville)

Do not play in the air ever it isn't worth it ur able to stay grounded due to him not getting as much from it, better to just dash around and shield 

Nair beats cross slash if it's not the sword so you can just fast fall nair and win 

If you get hit and you see them go to smash art then pound stall or just play neutral/ hold shield 

If shulk is in shield you can uptilt infinite at mid percent/ dair loop 

Its fine if they change to shield at low % since they cant use it for awhile so youll get mid percent combos 

Down throw gets rid of arts the fastest

Alot of shulk’s stuff is safe so its better or just get stage control and read a future option 
{Bowser Jr}*
If you read jr doing mechakoopa you can get a ton of damage and if you dont then just get center stage

Any of puffs forward facing aerials can handle clown kart (bowser side b well)

Jr has to parry in order to get an upsmash kill and even then jr can still miss if drifted properly

If you hit jr keep going dont even stop because say hes offstage then you can focus on an edgeguard over a combo, since puffs dair hits jr’s face doing dair loops actually does more damage.

If jr up b’s wait for the airdodge over just hitting jr immedaetiyl, alot of jr’s get away with it but now u know, just stay away at first and see if they hammer or not

Clown kart up b kills hella early if you dont di it, instead of worrying about getting hit just get ready to DI over having shock value from getting hit from it 

If you hit clown kart offstage they cant use it again usually, its similar to how pac man side b works where if you hit them out of the side b its gone but if you hit them again its back, all of jr’s aerials can be punished by parry

If jr is facing away expect back air or tomahawk grab

Jr’s jab kills so tilt ur shield and be ready if the situation occurs, 

Jr can combo with upthrow up air 
{Duck Hunt}*
If you get any normal dair loop or combo just hold shield after, if you hold shield after one dair then can will explode on them if you shield

This is a game where you want can anyway from duck hunt to get an edgeguard

When he's offstage wait for him to use can then punish 

Nair is the best option for edgeguarding because if you go for a combo then can comes out 

Duck hunt will always go for trades so think about if the trade is worth it

Duck hunt’s best move vs puff is up air so think about that move when youre in the air

Vs the plate (duck hunt side b) you can sdi it but it hardly matters, it has a ton of lag and it is a hard committal move 

Duck hunt has really weird pancaking so when hes doing an aerial expect him to pancake
{Ryu}*
His main gameplan on getting hits is a nair and its very safe vs puff being -2

U can try and scare with down air but the optimal option is nair/grab, most ken’s will shield cause its just a good option and puff’s aerials are fast enough to deal with ryu up b + ryu up b is risky and spotdodge loses to puff aerials 

Vs his down b you wanna either dair it or wait for it to end and nair the aftermath

His neutral b loses to any move in the game

Vs ryu combos sdi di the ken side b and up b down and away and up tilt up and away, you have enough time to do both but if you nervous just always do down and away, ryu can dtilt side b or other setups into side b, theyre true even if they dont look true, you can crouch under side b though

If ryu is completely under the stage u can fast fall nair and itll trade with any recovery option 

Vs ryu side b you can nair the top part of it every single time or just wait for the end lag 

{Ken}*
Ken can full hop/plat camp really well but has a weirdly hard time getting a hit

His main gameplan on getting hits is a nair and its very safe vs puff being -2

U can try and scare with down air but the optimal option is nair/grab, most ken’s will shield cause its just a good option and puff’s aerials are fast enough to deal with ken up b + ken up b is risky and spotdodge loses to puff aerials 

Vs his down b you wanna either dair it or wait for it to end and nair the aftermath

His neutral b loses to any move in the game

Vs ken combos sdi di the ken up b down and away and up tilt up and away, you have enough time to do both but if you nervous just always do down and away 

If ken is completely under the stage u can fast fall nair and itll trade with any recovery option 

Vs ken side b you can nair the top part of it every single time or just wait for the end lag 
Any pound combo will work on ken 

Ken can mash side b and go up slightly vertically 
{Cloud}*
When ur edgeguarding, try and see if the cloud will try and up b suicide and not immedaetiyl go in, nair can trade/beat up b if you do it at a similar time however

If you’re close to cloud if you’re shielding and he side b’s go for a grab

Do not try and grab/attack any of cloud’s aerials unless horribly drifted, they are safe on parry or the situation will never occur, you can mix it up  if you read a future option but it will not work in your favor unless there's a read 

Nair trades with up b

If cloud misses you with up b you can punish with just about anything if youre fast, you cant really hesitate

If cloud upsmashes and you can punish only go for something small, you can usually get any aerial but make sure to be precise and know what you want theres no improv combos and you cant really autopilot due to how cloud is (if you get an aerial try and get it to set up into a grab)

U can actually gimp cloud limit up b if you dont hit the sword hitbox with nair or any move really

If cloud has limit and he hits you far away with an aerial, you can actually pound stall a little bit once you get hit since your so far away, the counterplay for cloud is to use limit up b so still be careful

If you’re in neutral vs cloud in limit, holding shield is honestly ur best friend but tilting is even better since puff’s shield can get shield poked pretty well and cloud’s limit side b does hella shield damage

Lastly on ledge, dont pound from ledge or even try and be on ledge at time, try and stall being in even worse disadvantageous positions because of how good cloud is at ledge trapping, throwing the cloud player off can make ur life wayy easier on making it back to stage.


{Corrin}*
CORRIN IS SLOWWWWWWWW 

Corrin’s strengths are that even if theyre slow its very hard to actually hit corrin due to her hitboxes

Dont try to punish corrin bair just try and get stage control, its very safe due to the drift back that corrin’s bair has, her aerials are all actually pretty safe, if they fastfall i dont believe ur able to punish so watch for the option after the aerial 

Corrin’s weight makes it so corrin can not escape anything, so if you get hit you can just hold forward

Anything beats corrin up b at the start

Punish corrin nair with grab if you parry corrin nair over anything else, dair works if they dont read you going for it cause multi hit

If you are in the air it is rng if ur gonna make it back at times

You’re aerials can trade and its good to trade if it theyre already offstage and puts them even farther away






{Bayo}*
STAY GROUNDED

If bayo abk’s off ledge you can punish with up smash

Bayo’s heel slide can be punished with rest

Sdi di witch twist up if your confident about getting out of it but down and away is the safest option, vs abk always sdi down and away to make sure you dont get laddered and die

Witch time has enough lag to be punished by rest on reaction

Rest combos arent that reliable due to bat within

On edgeguarding, if bayo uses a witch twist then theyre forced to use a jump eventually, they can mixup but its really scary for bayo once you know this

Forward throw is not a real kill throw

Its a slow matchup but always play grounded

Vs bayo fair di down and away/survival DI 

Wait for bat within by just playing around her airdodges
{Inkling}*
Platform camping/ staying on a platform is your best bet usually, playing grounded is good but inkling usually has to make commitments to come to you

Your punish game is scarier then inkling’s so when you’re getting hit dont get stressed

When inkling is offstage its similar to hero where if you bring them below the stage its harder for them to use there drift although its still probably the same wherever you edgeguard its just the inkling has a higher chance of bonking there head below the stage 

You can nair below the ledger to edgeguard and it'll usually cover any mixup

Once you hit about 85-100 is when it starts to work (this is an estimate) at this % platform camp way more or treat it as the floor is lava and stay short hopping since inkling can cover a full hop way better

Inkling bair can be parried and punished with a grab usually but its too safe to punish with anything else unless you read them not shield/dropping a shield with an aerial, i prefer dair in these situations because of dair loops.

Roller can be shielded rested and it's just not viable vs puff and is only used as a super hard call out.


{Ridley}*
DAIR LOOPS 

Ridley will almost always recover low 

Dont go for rests unless u fully know itll work cause if you miss its a free down b and you take 60 at worst or you die 

Puff’s aerials can beat ridley’s side b
{Richter}*
FTHROWW
His tether is like any other tether u can just nair it if ur close and try and nair on the ledge if all else fails and if it misses then reset to ledge before he gets there, soft fair can also work 
Any whiff punish should lead to him being offstage realistcially or a situation to put him offstage 

SDI holy water up and away airdodge/no airdodge either way works, with away it should stop everything unless they time it perfect with upsmash

You can low profile ftilt and his basic moves by just rolling or getting back to the ground 

His up b loses to nair if u try and edgeguard 

His up b cant deal with cross ups/mix ups EX: drift away nair wont get up b’d reliably 

DONT DI UP/NO DI RICHTER UP B AT ALL ANYTHING ELSE IS BETTER!!!!!
Watch for the the richter side b at all times since it can combo into his up b if theyre a top lvl richter

Up b oos will never kill if you DI it properly so never stress about it killing espcially if its stale.


{K rool}*
Lots and lots of dair,

Rest beats crown armor and sing

If k rool is offstage and uses crown armor wait until it ends, takes awhile but with practice you get it everytime

Hold shield when hes landing over anti airing since he’ll usually try and use the armor from nair, ofc this would be a mixup but its a good mixup and you can dair it or grab or anything really 

{Isabelle}*


Isabelle likes recovering horizontally due to fishing rod

Nair beats slingshot 

Pound beats mine but its better to just bait them to use the mine

Dont try and follow isabelle try and keep center stage instead since isabelle can catch you with fsmash

U can sdi di the jab away and shield but if they read they can catch bad DI 

If ur trying to edgeguard isabelle bait her to use her up b or to use an aerial so you can punish end lag

{Incin}*
Incin only has neutral b to really deal with dair and a hard commitment side b at best, you can mash dair and incin has not much 

Focus everything on getting grabs because of revenge, ur forced to go for more due to the revenge mechanic, if you read a neutral b try and go for a nair to try and get them in tumble or rest/fthrow if ur confident

Get soft fairs over strong fairs vs incin due to his vertical up b, you wont be able to catch if you hit with strong hit moves, his side b has alot of lag so you can just keep hitting him if u cant get true combos

His neutral b is a good combo breaker at low % so see if he’ll use it

If you see him mashing side b just do alot of feints to wait it out and punish 
{Plant}*
You can rest the spike ball, you have to be close though so you dont get hit by when he throws it, also can Dthrow it

Dont be afraid to attack the down b, you can float under and wait for the cool down

If you hit plant with nair itll combo into anything

Pound 2 frame/ dmash 2 frame

Wait for them to come to you over you trying to hit them when plant is recovering

DONT REST AND THINK UR ALIVE, Plant can side b fsmash and youll take alot of damage at the best scenario if plant has the side b 

Upsmash oos is rly scary and upthrow is an above average kill throw
{Joker}*
It does not matter if joker is top 1 he still has a tether recovery and you can fthrow and edgeguard 

Ur goal in neutral is to find a dair and play footsies, other aerials are good but dair is amazing in this mu to spam not even for dair loops 

If joker has arsene you honestly just have to hope u guessed right vs joker, if ur in the air just camp and stall as much as possible, getting grabbed is fine at high %, at low % its scary cause you can get arsene up throw up air 

Gimping arsene up b is just nairing below the ledge with nair and watching out for joker arsene side b 

Gimping normal joker up b is using as little moves as possible so you dont get joker to have arsene up b, fair has way less end lag so at low % you can do fair nair or just fair chains, if you read a joker double jump then nair is perfect 

Nair can beat joker side b but its better to just weave around it, watch out it does more damage then anyone would expect 




{Hero}*
You can crouch under hero side b 1 and 2 but not the fully charged one

With menu try and make them scared to use a move since if your in the air its harder for them to want to do something since they could just mess up or just not have the item to deal with it

Hero will usually try and use up b oos since its really fast but dont get tilted since its not even much damage 

Focus on fthrow combos just because hero is gonna be limited on recovering since he has to go a set way even if there is a little bit of drift involved, i prefer dair in this matchup and edgeguarding them below the stage since they cant get zoom as well and the recovery is more limited 

Careful about hero’s neutral b if you’re on the ledge or in general since it does hella damage plus it kills

Kaboom is really really good vs puff so its better to shield if you see it since you can usually react, shes too slow so at times shes forced to interact with it.

Hero’s uptilt if hero has psyche up is really good and just hero uptilt is general it will be the anti air that can catch anything you’re doing basically 

Lastly hero acceleration makes hero a bit lighter.
{Banjo}*
The optimal way to play this is plat camping and to never interact

If you read wonderwing you can catch it with rest/sing if done right, it also has a lot of end lag being -54, wonderwing will always be used when recovering to the ledge

If a banjo grenades there's a high chance they’ll jump so look for that 

If you see a neutral b or the egg shooting thing then they're looking for an uptilt most likely

Oos if you don't drift well then banjo can up smash oos you

Down throw is a fake bury you can mash out at most percent 

Wait for the up b to come out and at %’s you can wall of pain or combo you can usually just kill banjo or give him a lot of % 

Banjo is combo food so any sort of combo you practice will work on him 

Lastly don't always drift into banjo instead keeping stage control is way more important since they can just wonderwing or just hold shield, although pound can work in this mu better than in others 



{Terry}*
The big weakness that is not utilized much is how much end lag there is on terry’s side b’s, if you read grounded crack shoot then you can react and dair, with the burning knuckle you can rest it or sing usually, in the air i just wait for them to use it since its a forced option and edgeguard due to terry being combo food 

If you're above when he's jabbing and you get hit sdi up and in, at low % this is good to do but at high % terry can just jab up b

If terry has the charged up b input then you want to bait it out and you can't do much about it but you'll notice them having if they shield more 

Don't try and punish powerdunk if you're shielding because it can be + and you'll just get mad you can't punish it

Down tilt and down smash can be good cheese options vs terry if terry is recovering 

If terry has go, nair can actually beat power geyser and buster wolf loses to shield and can be rested
buster wofl can be rested out of


{Byleth}-

{Min Min}*
FTHROW COMBOS (any aerial into fthrow is huge in this mu) 
Nair beats aerials rly badly so focus on that
Cover jump first then go downwards
Dont pummel so they might have worse DI
If you’re in disadvantage it’s good to have a hit box out since it beats aerials(of course  mix it up)
Min min’s nair can always be parried and you get a guaranteed’d punish like dair dair fair grab or just dair stuff in general/anything 

{STEVE}*
play defensive (when steve has diamonds) passive play is rly good vs steve since it makes him scared to mine

Always stay above steve to bait out an upsmash and to get him annoyed/scared

Pound beats minecart and even nair at times

Dont worry about killing steve off an edgeguard because % is huge

Dair combos are rly good on steve since he cant really escape anything 
Steve mains roll alot 
The exception for passive play is when steve only has wood/anything other then diamonds, go in and make him scared to mine anything since he’ll get hard punished with pound combos or just combos in general

Diamonds are safe don't try and punish or do anything about it, treat like cloud bair or a super safe move that u know of, you can maybe grab if u parried but only do if ur confident.

You can rest upsmash landing lag

Stay diagonal in neutral
Rushdown steve at the start of games to make him panic more 
{sephiroth}*
Doing rest for damage isn't worth it in this matchup because immediate one wing and that mu becomes WAYYY HARDER

Stay on the ground it's very annoying for sephiroth to hit you otherwise 

U can hit the up b attack version horizontally with fair and bair but it is a little hard so only do when practiced 

When ur in the air sephiroth will likely do up air, doing fastfall aerials to catch sephiroth before he does his up air is an unorthodox mixup, keep 2 jumps no matter what in disadvantage so u have some leeway, ofc u dont truly need 2 jumps but keeping something is huge vs big sword man

Sephiroth side b loses to Dthrow badly so if you know the timing 

Vs one wing theyll most likely go much further down since there's so many more mixups

If puff Fthrows sephiroth and he immediately up b’s the only potential way to edgeguard is pound at low % but even then if u read just wait and punish however u know how by staying on the ledge, baiting youll go out by just jumping can work 

{Mythra/pyra}*
Edgeguarding-

Mythra side b can lose to puff nair and dair and fair if you’re above at the right spot 

Pyra up b loses to nair 

Mythra up b loses to anything and can be 2 framed pretty easily


Neutral-

Stay grounded vs both characters since a grab doesnt do that much its similar to the neutral vs fox where you just wanna hold shield alot more then usually and focus more on getting them in bad spots over trying to win neutral over and over so you can see there habits since its possible to cheese the recovery 

Foresight-

This char can actually use foresight so much more then in most matchups, see if they like using foresight/spamming airdodge, if they do just read the airdodge or get a smaller punish.
Vs pyra you wanna fish for fthrow way more and realize pyra’s moves are safer then you think so dont try and punish them unless ur super close, pyra up b oos can be singed if they mess up and dont hit you, on the ledge pyra can just ftilt or do any move, pyra’s uptilt can be really good at catching you jumping out of disadvantage or in general, pyra can punish pound or most moves with fsmash so dont just autopilot.

Mythra’s combo game is based on bair and just strings over true combos, mythra is really good at keeping people in the air so don't be shocked if you're in the air at disadvantage for 30 seconds.
f{Kazuya}*

At low % it's the opposite then what'd you do vs ken, with kazuya they will usually want a grab, if you do get grabbed get ready to tech since at any % there's a chance you can die

Nair and other moves can trade with kazuya up b but the trade is usually worse for you so think about if its worth it 

Moves kazuya can stall in the air with are his neutral b which is the laser and a command being down b, it has super armor so be careful 

When he has his rage boost Ii like spotdodging alot more as an option but as a mixup of course, spotdodging is good because of his down b existing 

If your at high % kazuya will fish for dragon uppercut or use it much more since puff has 0 option to deal with it, your best bet is to wait out the end lag and not commit ever, see if they spam it before actually only looking for them to dragon uppercut, 

Smash attacks have armor 

You can sdi the jab in or out it doesnt matter but u need to sdi 

If the kazuya is getting you on a platform then be prepared to tech because if you dont your realistcially taking 70 or dying
